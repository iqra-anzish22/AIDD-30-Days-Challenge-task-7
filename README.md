📄 AIDD 30-Day Challenge: Task 7 Submission
1. Short Note on SPECKit Plus
SPECKit Plus is an open-source toolkit specially designed for AI Native and Software Defined Development (SDD) projects It helps us manage a projects full lifecycle by providing a structured, automated way to define, plan, and execute work  It makes sure our development process is efficient clear, and easy to repeat.

2. Short Answers for the 5 Core Concepts
1. /constitution (Foundation)
The Constitution Phase is the very first step where we set the ground rules for the project We define the projects main goals, scope, vision, and mission. It’s like creating an identity document for the project so everyone agrees on why we are building it and what the basic rules are.

2. /specify (Requirements)
The Specify Phase is where we create detailed requirements and documentation This is where we clearly state what exactly needs to be built We write down things like user stories, functional details, and technical specifications so the developers know precisely how the final product should look and behave.

3. /plan (Strategy and Timeline)
In the Plan Phase, we figure out how we are going to build it and when it will be ready. We take the detailed specifications and turn them into an actionable strategy. This involves setting milestones, creating a timeline, and deciding how to allocate our resources (people and time).

4. /tasks (Actionable Work)
The Tasks Phase breaks down the larger plans into small, specific, and assignable jobs. We create detailed tickets or tasks that have clear instructions and expected outcomes This ensures that every developer knows exactly what they need to do making the overall work measurable and easy to track.

5. /implement (Execution and Building)
The Implement Phase is the actual development stage. This is where the team writes the code, performs necessary tests, and integrates all the parts together. It's the execution of all the previous steps, where we turn the specifications and tasks into the final working product.
